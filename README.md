<p>
This repository contains information on topic areas and practical assignments that were completed as part of the LSE Data Analytics Career Accelerator
</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The Data Analytics Career Accelerator from The London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE) empowered me with the skills and knowledge to drive data-informed decision-making in diverse industries. This intensive 6-month program equipped me with a broad set of expertise in data analytics, encompassing enterprise databases and tools.

I honed my coding proficiency in Python and R, applying them to real-world data projects in business contexts. Additionally, I improved my communication skills by creating compelling data visualisations and delivering recommendations through video presentations for course assignments.

The program comprised three courses and an employer project, enabling me to develop a robust portfolio that showcases my newly acquired skills and competencies. Equipped with these tools, I am now confident to tackle complex business challenges with data-driven solutions in any organisation.
